\section{Introduction}
The intersection of particle physics, sensor technology, and artificial intelligence heralds a new era in experimental setups, particularly in the context of high-energy physics experiments such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At the heart of these experiments lies the challenge of accurately measuring the energies of particles, a task that is critical for advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. This research focuses on optimizing the size of sensors within Electromagnetic Calorimeters (ECAL), crucial for reconstructing the energies of photons, leveraging the advancements in deep learning to achieve unprecedented precision.

The accurate reconstruction of photon energies is a cornerstone for numerous analyses in particle physics. However, the physical design and cost constraints of ECAL sensors pose significant challenges. The trade-off between sensor resolution and the economic feasibility of high-resolution sensors necessitates a sophisticated approach to sensor design. This research addresses the challenge of identifying an optimal sensor size that ensures precise energy measurements without incurring prohibitive costs. The significance of this endeavor cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the feasibility and success of future high-energy physics experiments.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based model that can adapt to various sensor sizes, essentially enabling the reconstruction of photon energies with high precision across a range of sensor configurations. This approach draws inspiration from successful architectures in computer vision, incorporating layers that adjust the input sensor matrix size to a standard format, thereby allowing the model to learn the most effective patterns for energy reconstruction.

Our methodology is grounded in a comprehensive review of existing literature, including seminal works on calorimetry with deep learning, computer vision techniques for particle flow reconstruction, and domain continuation methods for merged photon reconstruction in collider experiments. These studies provide both the theoretical and practical foundation for applying deep learning in the context of particle physics, specifically in the optimization of sensor sizes.

The novelty of our research lies in its application of deep learning to the specific problem of sensor size optimization for photon energy reconstruction. Unlike previous studies that focused on general energy measurement and particle identification, our work specifically targets the optimization of ECAL sensor configurations, proposing a scalable and adaptable deep learning solution.

We anticipate that our deep learning model will enable the identification of an optimal sensor size configuration, balancing the trade-offs between resolution and cost. This outcome will have profound implications for the design and execution of future experiments in particle physics, potentially leading to more cost-effective and accurate measurements.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed literature review, highlighting key advancements and identifying gaps our research aims to fill. Section 3 describes our methodology, including the data acquisition process, model design, and experimental setup. Section 4 presents the results of our experiments, analyzing the performance of different sensor sizes and model configurations. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of our findings, their implications, and directions for future research.

\subsubsection{Introduction to Aspect Two: Sensor Design and Optimization}

Sensor design and optimization in the context of high-energy physics experiments are critical for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of particle detection and energy measurement. The challenge lies in balancing the resolution, cost, and practical feasibility of sensor configurations, a topic that has received considerable attention in the literature.

Studies focusing on the optimization of sensor designs, such as the analysis of pixel size in silicon detectors and the impact of sensor granularity on energy resolution, provide valuable insights into the trade-offs involved in sensor configuration. These works highlight the importance of considering both technical and economic factors in the design of detectors for particle physics experiments.

The literature on sensor design and optimization underscores the complexity of achieving optimal configurations for energy measurement. This body of work informs our approach to leveraging deep learning for sensor size optimization, suggesting that a balance must be struck between sensor resolution and cost-effectiveness.

\subsection{Methodology}
Our methodology centers on developing a novel deep learning architecture tailored for optimizing sensor size in the context of particle physics experiments, particularly focusing on energy reconstruction of photons in the Large Hadron Collider's (LHC) Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL).

The primary objective is to devise a deep learning model capable of accurately reconstructing the initial energy of photons across a spectrum of sensor sizes, thereby identifying an optimal sensor configuration that offers a judicious balance between performance and cost.

The experimental framework is constructed around the hypothesis that integrating specialized layers into deep learning models, akin to those found in ResNet architectures, can effectively standardize input from varying sensor sizes, enabling consistent model performance across different configurations. This approach posits that adaptability to sensor size variations can be achieved without compromising the model's accuracy in energy reconstruction tasks.

Data for model training and validation are generated using GEANT4 simulations, which provide a comprehensive set of photon interaction events within ECAL sensors of varying sizes. This simulated dataset encompasses a wide range of energy levels and interaction types, offering a robust foundation for evaluating the model's performance.

The proposed model architecture incorporates initial layers designed to adjust the input from sensors of varying resolutions to a uniform format, facilitating efficient learning and adaptation. Subsequent layers are structured to extract and process spatial and energy information from the standardized input, culminating in the reconstruction of the photon's initial energy. The model is trained using a combination of simulated data, with performance evaluated against a set of predefined metrics, including accuracy and precision in energy reconstruction.

Key challenges encountered during the study include ensuring the model's adaptability to diverse sensor sizes and configurations, as well as addressing the computational complexities associated with processing large-scale datasets. Additionally, the study considers the economic implications of sensor design choices, recognizing the need to balance technical performance with cost-efficiency in sensor manufacturing.
